# Services UI

Welcome to visual documentation for the (work-in-progress) Services UI library. We have the following structure for Vue components:

1. **Foundation**: Foundational items (typography, icons, spacing, etc.)
2. **Components**: Design system components (buttons, badges, etc.)
3. **Patterns**: Custom usage or bundling of two or more design system components (copy button, standard footer, etc.)

## V-Model

Storybook doesn't support dynamic binding of v-model through story args. So a work-around is in place where if the args
contain `modelValue` it will pipe it into v-model. In source examples replace `:modelValue` with `v-model`.

## Element name styling

Generally you'll want to kebab-case element names (e.g. `<SyncCard>` -> `<sync-card>`.)
Storybook doesn't allow us to format their autodoc source files without overriding it entirely.

## Localization

Localization is supplied by vue-i18n. However there currently isn't a switch for available, so it defaults to your
navigator.language value.

To adjust it, create a localstorage key named `locale` with the value of either `en` (English) or `de` (German).
